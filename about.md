## About
Hi! My name is Michal Szulc.

Currently I'm a webdeveloper and a bussiness owner of the small company [majkesz.pl](https://majkesz.pl/) localised in Poland.

I'm fascinated with the Grails framework (based on Spring/JVM/Groovy) and the REST microservices architecture.

After hours I like to dig into a webSec or craft in the carpentry workshop.

### Contracts
I'm open for a new part-time opportunities ( <30h/month ).
