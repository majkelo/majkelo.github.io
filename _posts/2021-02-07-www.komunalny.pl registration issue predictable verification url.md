title: www.komunalny.pl registration issue - predictable verification url
---
### Website:
[https://www.komunalny.pl](https://www.komunalny.pl) - you can register an account to any email address, cause verification link which sended by email is predictable

### Risk [low level]:

An attacker was able to create an account in behalf of unaware victim and verify the account by sending prepared GET request with predicted query params. In result the victim could be spammed with unsolicited content via komunalny.pl newsletter or even by vendor marketing emails.

### Description:
First we are submitting the registration form:

![Registration form](img/2021-02-07/registration-page.png "Registration form")

The verification link sended after submition has an easy to guess structure:

https://portalkomunalny.pl/?aa=1&id=**INTEGER**

eg: https://portalkomunalny.pl/?aa=1&id=123

In this link:
  - we have a static `aa` query param with value `1`
  - we have `id` query param with iterated integers reflecting user ids

### Solution:

Right now verification link isn't properly secured with unpredictable (hard to guess) token, which will be unique for every submitted registration request and checked server-side. Do recommend adding such a token to verification link and check it later on backend.
