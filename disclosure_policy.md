## Disclosure Policy
I maintain the following policy of responsible disclosure:

-   I will announce vulnerabilities via [techblog](majkelo.github.io).
-   Vulnerabilities are published if no response is received from the author of the vulnerable product within one week of initial contact.
-   If response is received, disclosure is coordinated with product vendor.
